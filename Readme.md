# Advance Groundwater Modelling - Project work

This repository is used for sharing current results of the modelling project of the class _Advanced Groundwater Modelling_ at TU Darmstadt, Germany. 

# To-Do Liste

- [x] Model objective
     First model GW-heads (steady state)
    - Then particle transport
    - Then try changing the model:
        - lower hydraulic conductivity along river
        - wells next to river for pumping and infiltration

- [ ] Choice of model type
- [ ] Collection and interpretation of data
    - [ ] Assign hydraulic parameters to different geological units based on drillings and so on.
    - [ ] Get DGM1 for project area
    - [ ] Check for literature
- [ ] Development of conceptual hydrogeological model
    - [ ] Think about which information we want to include in our model and which information can be simplified.
- [x] choice of software
    - ModelMuse, Modflow 2005
- [ ] Pre-processing of data
    - [ ] create shapefiles with the fields necessary (hydraulic conductivity, ...) in GIS. This will be imported to ModelMuse.
- [ ] Model set up
    - [ ] Build Grid in Modelmuse
    - [ ] Create objects by importing the shapefiles
- [ ] Model calibration
- [ ] Sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis
- [ ] Model validation
    - [ ] compare to the isolines from HLNUG
    - [ ] critical thinking. Do the results make sense?
- [ ] Model application, e.g. prognostic runs
    - [ ] Change hydraulic conductivity along the river
    - [ ] Add wells to infiltrate water -> barrier for particles
    - [ ] Add wells to pump water -> particle sink
- [ ] Analysis of results (if necessary interation of previous steps)
- [ ] Post-processing of data
